#### Description:
Hey there! Welcome to my personal Python project of mine that simplifies your calorie tracking, no fluff! With easy calorie tracking, easy goal setting, and even the ability  to see your meal logs, WorldWideTracker makes dieting convenient!

WorldWideTracker comes equipped with a wide range of features that simplify the process of managing your diet and staying on track with your health goals. Designed with user convenience in mind, it serves as a reliable companion for anyone striving to improve their lifestyle through better eating habits. 

Whether your goal is to gain muscle, lose weight, or simply maintain a healthier lifestyle, WorldWideTracker is tailored to help you achieve results without the added stress or complexity. By taking the guesswork out of dieting, it enables you to focus on your progress while cultivating long-term habits for sustainable health and fitness.

## Features
### Confirmed Features
- âœ… Track Your Calories: Manually search for the meal or snack you're finding for, and access a vast ocean of food items to know the nutritional details. Youâ€™ll never have to guess whatâ€™s on your plate again
- âœ… Meal Log: Keep a comprehensive log of your daily meals. With this feature, you can track your caloric intake, monitor your progress, and adjust your diet as needed to stay on target.
- âœ… Setting Goals: Easily set your dieting goals with some simple questions! Get a recommendation at the end! ðŸ˜‰
- âœ… Completely FREE: Unlike many similar programs, WorldWideTracker is completely free to use. There are no subscriptions, hidden fees, or premium plans. Everyone deserves access to tools that can help them achieve a healthier lifestyle, and WorldWideTracker makes that possible.

### Discontuined Features
At the start of the project, I had this idea of barcode scanning being one of the features that would make WorldWideTracker more user-friendly. However, as development progressed, I realized that it requires much more resources from third-party integrations, lots of errors in making the 
barcode functionality work, and the chances of an incompatibility with the user's camera.

Hence, given the project's scope, I made the difficult decision to discontinue the feature for the time being. While barcode scanning is no longer part of the confirmed features, it remains a possibility for future updates as I continue to refine and expand WorldWideTracker.

## Learning Outcomes
- Improving my programming skills: By the end of the project, I wish to learn more about Python and SQL.
- Problem-Solving Practice: Tackling programming ideas like data validation, API requests, error handling help me improve my problem-solving skills.
- Healthier Lifestyle: As someone pursuing fitness goals, this project also helps me streamline my diet, enabling me to build muscle more effectively.
